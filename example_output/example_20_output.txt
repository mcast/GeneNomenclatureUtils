      postsynaptic density.
PG  - 19-21
AB  - We isolated the postsynaptic density from human neocortex (hPSD) and
      identified 1,461 proteins. hPSD mutations cause 133 neurological and
      psychiatric diseases and were enriched in cognitive, affective and motor
      phenotypes underpinned by sets of genes. Strong protein sequence
      conservation in mammalian lineages, particularly in hub proteins,
      indicates conserved function and organization in primate and rodent
      models. The hPSD is an important structure for nervous system disease and
      behavior.

TI  - Targeted tandem affinity purification of PSD-95 recovers core postsynaptic
      complexes and schizophrenia susceptibility proteins.
PG  - 269
AB  - The molecular complexity of mammalian proteomes demands new methods for
      mapping the organization of multiprotein complexes. Here, we combine mouse
      genetics and proteomics to characterize synapse protein complexes and
      interaction networks. New tandem affinity purification (TAP) tags were
      fused to the carboxyl terminus of PSD-95 using gene targeting in mice.
      Homozygous mice showed no detectable abnormalities in PSD-95 expression,
      subcellular localization or synaptic electrophysiological function.
      Analysis of multiprotein complexes purified under native conditions by
      mass spectrometry defined known and new interactors: 118 proteins
      comprising crucial functional components of synapses, including glutamate
      receptors, K+ channels, scaffolding and signaling proteins, were
      recovered. Network clustering of protein interactions generated five
      connected clusters, with two clusters containing all the major ionotropic
      glutamate receptors and one cluster with voltage-dependent K+ channels.
      Annotation of clusters with human disease associations revealed that
      multiple disorders map to the network, with a significant correlation of
      schizophrenia within the glutamate receptor clusters. This targeted TAP
      tagging strategy is generally applicable to mammalian proteomics and
      systems biology approaches to disease.

TI  - Automated design of genomic Southern blot probes.
PG  - 74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sothern blotting is a DNA analysis technique that has found
      widespread application in molecular biology. It has been used for gene
      discovery and mapping and has diagnostic and forensic applications,
      including mutation detection in patient samples and DNA fingerprinting in
      criminal investigations. Southern blotting has been employed as the
      definitive method for detecting transgene integration, and successful
      homologous recombination in gene targeting experiments.The technique
      employs a labeled DNA probe to detect a specific DNA sequence in a complex
      DNA sample that has been separated by restriction-digest and gel
      electrophoresis. Critically for the technique to succeed the probe must be
      unique to the target locus so as not to cross-hybridize to other
      endogenous DNA within the sample.Investigators routinely employ a manual
      approach to probe design. A genome browser is used to extract DNA sequence
      from the locus of interest, which is searched against the target genome
      using a BLAST-like tool. Ideally a single perfect match is obtained to the
      target, with little cross-reactivity caused by homologous DNA sequence
      present in the genome and/or repetitive and low-complexity elements in the
      candidate probe. This is a labor intensive process often requiring several
      attempts to find a suitable probe for laboratory testing. RESULTS: We have
      written an informatic pipeline to automatically design genomic Sothern
      blot probes that specifically attempts to optimize the resultant probe,
      employing a brute-force strategy of generating many candidate probes of
      acceptable length in the user-specified design window, searching all
      against the target genome, then scoring and ranking the candidates by
      uniqueness and repetitive DNA element content. Using these in silico
      measures we can automatically design probes that we predict to perform as
      well, or better, than our previous manual designs, while considerably
      reducing design time.We went on to experimentally validate a number of
      these automated designs by Southern blotting. The majority of probes we
      tested performed well confirming our in silico prediction methodology and
      the general usefulness of the software for automated genomic Southern
      probe design. CONCLUSIONS: Software and supplementary information are

TI  - Confirmed rare copy number variants implicate novel genes in
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 445-51
AB  - Understanding how cognitive processes including learning, memory, decision
      making and ideation are encoded by the genome is a key question in
      biology. Identification of sets of genes underlying human mental disorders
      is a path towards this objective. Schizophrenia is a common disease with
      cognitive symptoms, high heritability and complex genetics. We have
      identified genes involved with schizophrenia by measuring differences in
      DNA copy number across the entire genome in 91 schizophrenia cases and 92
      controls in the Scottish population. Our data reproduce rare and common
      variants observed in public domain data from >3000 schizophrenia cases,
      confirming known disease loci as well as identifying novel loci. We found
      copy number variants in PDE10A (phosphodiesterase 10A), CYFIP1
      [cytoplasmic FMR1 (Fragile X mental retardation 1)-interacting protein 1],
      K(+) channel genes KCNE1 and KCNE2, the Down's syndrome critical region 1
      gene RCAN1 (regulator of calcineurin 1), cell-recognition protein CHL1
      (cell adhesion molecule with homology with L1CAM), the transcription
      factor SP4 (specificity protein 4) and histone deacetylase HDAC9, among
      others (see http://www.genes2cognition.org/SCZ-CNV). Integrating the
      function of these many genes into a coherent model of schizophrenia and
      cognition is a major unanswered challenge.

TI  - Neurotransmitters drive combinatorial multistate postsynaptic density
      networks.
PG  - ra19
AB  - The mammalian postsynaptic density (PSD) comprises a complex collection of
      approximately 1100 proteins. Despite extensive knowledge of individual
      proteins, the overall organization of the PSD is poorly understood. Here,
      we define maps of molecular circuitry within the PSD based on
      phosphorylation of postsynaptic proteins. Activation of a single
      neurotransmitter receptor, the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR),
      changed the phosphorylation status of 127 proteins. Stimulation of
      ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors and dopamine receptors
      activated overlapping networks with distinct combinatorial phosphorylation
      signatures. Using peptide array technology, we identified specific
      phosphorylation motifs and switching mechanisms responsible for the
      integration of neurotransmitter receptor pathways and their coordination
      of multiple substrates in these networks. These combinatorial networks
      confer high information-processing capacity and functional diversity on
      synapses, and their elucidation may provide new insights into disease
      mechanisms and new opportunities for drug discovery.
